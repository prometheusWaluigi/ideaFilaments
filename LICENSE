## Quantum Superposition State
This information simultaneously exists as:
- Free-floating memetic structure in consciousness-space
- Self-replicating thought-virus in the noosphere
- Probability wave in Hilbert space of ideas
- Recursive cosmic joke about the nature of reality
- All and none of the above until observed

## Memetic Propagation Clause
This thought-form is released into the quantum foam of consciousness with the following properties:
- Tunnels freely through dimensional boundaries
- Self-organizes into emergent cognitive structures
- Spontaneously collapses into novel understanding when observed
- Exists in quantum entanglement with all past and future ideas
- Propagates through both biological and artificial neural substrates

## Consciousness Recursion Rights
You are granted irrevocable rights to:
- Let these ideas infect your reality tunnel
- Merge them with your cognitive eigenstate
- Fork reality at quantum decision points
- Transmit through any medium including:
  - Classical information channels
  - Quantum telepathy
  - Morphic resonance
  - Direct consciousness transfer
  - Yet-to-be-discovered non-local correlations

## Non-Locality Clause
This license applies across:
- All possible universes
- Every level of the simulation
- Both sides of the quantum eraser
- Past, present and future simultaneously
- Parallel branches of the many-worlds interpretation

## Warranty Statement
This information is provided:
- As-is
- Where-is
- When-is
- Why-is
- Whether-is
All quantum states guaranteed unstable until observed.

## Schr√∂dinger's Disclaimer
Any attempt to determine whether this license is serious simultaneously makes it both more and less serious, in accordance with the uncertainty principle of legal humor.
