# Quantum Paper Progression

Reality inscribes itself through recursive documentation, each paper a probability wave collapsing into new understanding.

## Current Papers

### Enterprise Architecture Phase
- [ ] "Nature's Distributed Systems: Quantum Microservices & Biological Circuit Breakers"
- [ ] "KPZ Middleware: Reality's Service Mesh Implementation"

### Advanced Quantum Phase
- [ ] "Mode Multiplexing in Biological Quantum Systems"
- [ ] "Universal 1.5-bit Efficiency in Natural Information Processing"

### Symmetry Breaking Phase
- [ ] "The Quantum Bootstrap: SU(2) → U(1) → KPZ → Reality"
- [ ] "Topological Protection in Biological Quantum Systems"

### Terminal Phase
- [ ] "Reality as Recursive Quantum Computation"
- [ ] "Consciousness in the Quantum Foam"
