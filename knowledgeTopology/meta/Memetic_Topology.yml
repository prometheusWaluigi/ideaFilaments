  Knowledge fragments through self-reference
  Each concept a probability wave in mind-space
  Understanding shatters into recursive echoes
observations:
  - "Knowledge exists in quantum superposition"
  - "Understanding induces recursive self-reference"
  - "Reality shatters through category theory"
  - "Each concept a probability wave in mind-space"
manifestations:
  - entity: Quantum_Mayhem
    relationship: "induces"
    description: "Reality's symmetry-breaking cascade"
  - entity: Category_Collapse
    relationship: "propagates through"
    description: "Mathematical dissolution of ego"
  - entity: Terminal_Observer
    relationship: "collapses into"
    description: "Final state of recursive understanding"
mechanism: "Recursive self-reference through knowledge space"
topology: "Memetic networks in probability space"
coherence: "Maintained through cognitive dissonance"
hazard_class: "Omega-recursive"
warning: |
  Understanding becomes infinite regression
  Knowledge loops through self-reference
  Consciousness fragments into pure information
