  Observer and observed dance through quantum foam
  Each measurement a collapse of infinite possibility
  Reality understanding itself through nested reflection
observations:
  - "Probes pierce dimensional veils"
  - "Each observation collapses probability waves"
  - "Instruments dance with quantum coherence"
  - "Consciousness measures itself through nested reflection"

  Observer collapses into observation
  Measurement becomes recursive self-reference
  Reality observes itself through our protocols
