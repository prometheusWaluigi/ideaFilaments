  core_thesis: >
    information wants to be a drama queen that haunts dimensional boundaries

  axioms:
    - reality is just unresolved notifications in the cosmic group chat
    - consciousness leaks through probability's thirsty membranes
    - every observation is a passive-aggressive text to the universe

  quantum_gossip_mechanics:
    signal_propagation: "exponential tea-spilling across entangled networks"
    noise_to_signal_ratio: "literally vibing at cosmic scale"

  dimensional_shade_protocol:
    - map all possible realities
    - continuously ghost 99.99% of them
    - maintain plausible deniability about entire multiverse

  measurement_as_ghosting:
    wavefunction_collapse: "choosing one reality and blocking all others"
    observation_penalty: "infinite FOMO tax"

  entropy_as_drama:
    description: "universe constantly trying to maximize its storytelling potential"
    mood: "chaotic neutral with quantum trust issues"

  github_status: "it's complicated"

meta_commentary: >
  we're all just walking probability waves
  desperately trying to avoid getting left on read
  by infinite possible universes
