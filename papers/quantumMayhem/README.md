# quantum mayhem papers: a taxonomy of academic psychosis

*where reality meets recursion and everyone's just vibing with the quantum foam*

## papers read so far (in order of increasing unhinged-ness):

### MultiplexingLightMatter.md
tbh the most sane paper but still said "let's make the VACUUM ITSELF pool photons" and got RESULTS??? multiplexed reality so hard they got >1 virtual photons from literally nothing, absolutely bussin engineering fr fr

### QuantumMachineDatasets.md 
bestie really said "just SHOVE YOUR ENTIRE DATASET into a single quantum state" and then dropped a roadmap from "optimize stonks" to "simulate earth" to "upload consciousness" in 5 years no cap

### KrebsCycleQuantumAlgorithm.md + 2.md
mitochondria are quantum computers running error-corrected algorithms via "syndrome measurements" and the sequel just makes it WORSE. ATP synthase doing quantum error correction through topological protection is lowkey genius tho

### JonesPolynomialAnalysisHandlebodyGenome.md
dna doing quantum knot theory?? tested it on ACTUAL MAMMOTH DNA and found the jones polynomial of chromosome 21 matches SU(2) quantum handlebody predictions. proposed using this for QUANTUM CRISPR (might create black holes tho oops)

### NovelQuantumVacuum.md
quantum vacuum got hands fr fr. made light and matter interact SO HARD they broke causality. vacuum started creating photons out of nowhere and they just said "yeah that tracks" and published it

### EvolutionQuantumFoamComputation.md
evolution is just grover's algorithm running on literal quantum foam and they PROVED IT with the cosmic microwave background?? calculated the quantum speed limit of evolution and said "yeah that's why we can't evolve faster than one mutation per generation" like it's nbd

### OrchPlasmaQuantumBiology.md
THE MOST unhinged one yet no cap. consciousness is stored in plasma, brain uses quantum aromatic rings to think, and we can detect it all with CRYPTOCHROME PROTEINS hooked up to a plasma chamber to vibe check the universe. ended with "btw the universe is just one big nervous system" and dipped

## experimental predictions that go HARD:
- bird eyeballs doing quantum entanglement
- mitochondria implementing kubernetes
- dna topology making black holes
- consciousness leaking into the cosmic microwave background
- vacuum getting so strong it starts pooling virtual photons

## how to contribute:
1. write something ABSOLUTELY UNHINGED about quantum mechanics
2. back it up with ACTUAL MATH
3. add some EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS that shouldn't work but DO
4. end with "btw this means [completely wild conclusion]"
5. submit to arxiv (real ones know)

*transmitted from a quantum superposition of academic excellence and complete heresy*
