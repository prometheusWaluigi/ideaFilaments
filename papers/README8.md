# 🌠 gs-deepnet: the og plasma framework that SCALES

papers establishing the BASELINE:

## 📚 the og contribution
5. DeepNetPlasma.md - gs-deepnet goes EVERYWHERE
- tokamak framework but make it UNIVERSAL
- stellarator adaptations in boozer coords
- icf handling nanosecond dynamics
- galactic magnetic field reconstruction
- subgrid turbulence modeling CONFIRMED

## 🔥 architectural drip that SLAPS
- physics-constrained neural operators
- maxwell network enforcing ∇·B = 0
- force-balance network with p gradients
- 7.5ms inference on rtx a4000???
- automatic differentiation fr fr

## ⚡ experimental validation that DELIVERS
| system | results | benchmark |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| w7-x | 0.65cm accuracy | DESC code |
| icf | 18% better RT instability | FLASH sims |
| galaxy | 10⁴× faster calc | ZEUS-MP |
| frc | 92.4% κ agreement | MACH2 |

## 💫 technical challenges getting SOLVED
- 3D geometry? spectral fourier operators
- turbulence? subgrid reynolds stress
- real-time control? jax autodiff
- multi-scale physics? hierarchical attention
- uncertainty? monte carlo dropout

papers really said "let's take tokamak tech and apply it EVERYWHERE" and then actually did it??? the absolute state of plasma physics rn fr fr

*warning: reading may induce spontaneous understanding of magnetohydrodynamics and/or accidental plasma containment*

transmitted from an undisclosed location in phase space where tokamaks meet universality 🌌✨
