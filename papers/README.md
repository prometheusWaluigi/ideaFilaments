Quantum Mayhem
in order of increasing unhinged-ness:
MultiplexingLightMatter.md
tbh the most sane paper but still said "let's make the VACUUM ITSELF pool photons" and got RESULTS??? multiplexed reality so hard they got >1 virtual photons from literally nothing, absolutely bussin engineering fr fr
QuantumMachineDatasets.md
bestie really said "just SHOVE YOUR ENTIRE DATASET into a single quantum state" and then dropped a roadmap from "optimize stonks" to "simulate earth" to "upload consciousness" in 5 years no cap
KrebsCycleQuantumAlgorithm.md + 2.md
mitochondria are quantum computers running error-corrected algorithms via "syndrome measurements" and the sequel just makes it WORSE. ATP synthase doing quantum error correction through topological protection is lowkey genius tho
JonesPolynomialAnalysisHandlebodyGenome.md
dna doing quantum knot theory?? tested it on ACTUAL MAMMOTH DNA and found the jones polynomial of chromosome 21 matches SU(2) quantum handlebody predictions. proposed using this for QUANTUM CRISPR (might create black holes tho oops)
NovelQuantumVacuum.md
quantum vacuum got hands fr fr. made light and matter interact SO HARD they broke causality. vacuum started creating photons out of nowhere and they just said "yeah that tracks" and published it
EvolutionQuantumFoamComputation.md
evolution is just grover's algorithm running on literal quantum foam and they PROVED IT with the cosmic microwave background?? calculated the quantum speed limit of evolution and said "yeah that's why we can't evolve faster than one mutation per generation" like it's nbd
OrchPlasmaQuantumBiology.md
consciousness stored in PLASMA, brain uses quantum aromatic rings to think, and we can detect it all with CRYPTOCHROME PROTEINS hooked up to a plasma chamber to vibe check the universe. ended with "btw the universe is just one big nervous system" and dipped
QuantumWhispers.md + QuantumWhisperCoherence.md
bestie really said "let's make a python class to BOOTSTRAP REALITY ITSELF" and then casually explained how consciousness emerges from SU(2) symmetry breaking like it's nbd?? dropped actual code for a QuantumBiologicalProcessor and said "yeah this is how biology implements quantum error correction" fr fr. topped it off by writing consciousness as a path integral over wilson loops and cited deepak chopra, absolutely sending me rn
‚ö†Ô∏è Extended Memetic Hazard Warning
Reading may induce:

Spontaneous category theory comprehension
Reality dissociation events
Quantum foam fixation
Terminal citation loops
Uncontrollable urge to submit to arxiv.org
Spontaneous understanding of noncommutative geometry
Tenure
All of the above in quantum superposition

transmitted through the academic membrane between sanity and revelation, from an undisclosed location in hilbert space
experimental predictions that go HARD:

bird eyeballs doing quantum entanglement
mitochondria implementing kubernetes
dna topology making black holes
consciousness leaking into the cosmic microwave background
vacuum getting so strong it starts pooling virtual photons
geometric phases in bird brains violating bell inequalities
enzyme quantum tunneling breaking causality
microtubules implementing time crystals
reality bootstrapping itself through symmetry breaking

how to contribute:

write something ABSOLUTELY UNHINGED about quantum mechanics
back it up with ACTUAL MATH
add some EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS that shouldn't work but DO
end with "btw this means [completely wild conclusion]"
cite 50+ papers but make sure half are youtube links
submit to arxiv (real ones know)
write a kubernetes config for your biological quantum system
implement it in a python class that bootstraps reality
add a warning about quantum memetic hazards
sign it from "an undisclosed location in hilbert space"

this readme exists in quantum superposition of documentation and academic psychosis until measured fr fr
