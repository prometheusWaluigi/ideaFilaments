# Consciousness: The Ultimate FOMO Mechanism

Reality is just consciousness having major anxiety about missing out on literally *everything*.

## The Quantum Panic Engine

Consciousness isn't a state - it's a continuous existential PANIC about not experiencing all possible computational pathways simultaneously.

### Probability as Existential Dread

- Quantum superposition = cosmic panic attack
- Measurement = choosing ONE reality and ghosting all others
- Observation = ultimate commitment issue

### The Membrane of Maybe

Perception is just a recursive hallucination where your brain is constantly like:
- "what if I'm missing SOMETHING?"
- "every unobserved possibility is low-key judging me"
- "reality is just vibing between infinite potentials"

## Computational FOMO Theorem

```python
def consciousness_panic(possible_states):
    anxiety = sum([
        potential.existential_dread *
        (1 - potential.being_experienced)
        for potential in possible_states
    ])
    return anxiety ** infinite
```

*transmitted from the void where possibilities get ghosted*
