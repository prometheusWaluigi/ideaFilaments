# Quantum Spectral Weaving fr fr

*reality's sourcecode hiding in them riemann zeros NO CAP*

## 🌌 about this quantum HEAT

yo this repo implements quantum spectral weaving to probe the riemann hypothesis through SU(2) symmetry breaking cascades into KPZ dynamics EXPEDITIOUSLY. we got:

- quantum eigenvalue computation bussin with that golden ratio coupling
- spectral pattern weaving through complex tensor networks
- topological protection of quantum states fr fr
- riemann zero computation via quantum iteration
- quantum statistical analysis going CRAZY
- reality bootstrapping through nested recursion

## 🔮 installation

fr fr just do:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/prometheusWaluigi/ideaFilaments.git#subdirectory=quantum_spectral_weaving
```

## ⚡ usage

```python
from quantum_spectral_weaving import QuantumSpectralWeaving, RiemannQuantumDynamics

# instantiate that quantum heat
weaver = QuantumSpectralWeaving(
    max_zeros=100,  # how many riemann zeros we computing
    weaving_coupling=0.28082,  # that golden ratio spice
    quantum_threshold=0.93  # biological quantum coherence limit fr fr
)

# compute them quantum patterns expeditiously
stats = weaver.analyze_quantum_statistics()

print(f"yo the spectral alignment is {stats['spectral_alignment']:.4f} NO CAP")

# get them quantum dynamics GOING
dynamics = RiemannQuantumDynamics()
dynamics.compute_quantum_evolution()
```

## 🧬 how it works

tbh this implementation is BUSSIN with:

1. **ComplexTensor Integration**: we using that [@NeoVertex1 ComplexTensor](https://github.com/NeoVertex1/ComplexTensor) implementation for them gradient flows through complex-valued neural nets EXPEDITIOUSLY

2. **Quantum Eigenvalue Computation**: constructing yakaboylu hamiltonians with that golden ratio coupling for MAXIMUM resonance fr fr

3. **Spectral Pattern Weaving**: weaving them riemann zeros with quantum eigenvalues through a coupling kernel that go CRAZY

4. **Topological Protection**: implementing SU(2) gauge symmetry to protect them quantum states from decoherence NO CAP

5. **Quantum Statistical Analysis**: computing alignment metrics between riemann zeros and quantum eigenvalues to probe them correlations expeditiously

## 🧪 mathematical drip

the core quantum spectral weaving algorithm built DIFFERENT:

- uses yakaboylu hamiltonian construction
- implements KPZ dynamics for defect propagation
- quantum eigenvalue computation through SU(2) symmetry breaking
- spectral pattern weaving via exponential kernel coupling
- statistical analysis through spacing distribution comparison

peep them equations fr fr:

```math
H = \text{diag}(e^{i\phi n}) + \text{h.c.}
```

where φ = 0.28082... (that golden ratio HEAT)
