# This module implements the main QuantumSpectralWeaving class, which
# orchestrates the simulation. It combines spectral information (inspired
# by the Riemann zeta function) with topological protection mechanisms
# (inspired by toric codes and SU(2) gauge fields). The overall goal is
# to simulate a quantum system that exhibits both rich dynamics and
# robustness against errors, drawing a conceptual parallel to the
# 1.5-bit principle's emphasis on efficiency and resilience.  The
# connections to the Riemann Hypothesis and topological quantum field
# theory are *conceptual* and *simplified*; this code is not a
# rigorous implementation of those mathematical frameworks.
