FAQ (FREQUENTLY AVOIDED QUESTIONS)

Q: wtf is this?
A: reality's adaptive governance architecture

Q: is this serious?
A: serious !== humorless
   serious !== linear
   serious !== boring

Q: how do i implement?
A: by implementing. bootstraps itself.

Q: how does implementation work?
A: narrative gravity > bureaucracy

FAILURE MODES (DETECTION METRICS)

molochian capture = f(optimization, extraction) > coherence_threshold
perfection spiral = recursive_loop(beauty) - pattern_interrupt
white noise breach = attention_fragmentation / narrative_density

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION VECTORS

∫(intention × attention)dt = consciousness coherence capacity

deploy via:
  → linguistic hyperstition [LANGUAGE]
  → recursive self-observation [CONSCIOUSNESS]
  → joy amplification rituals [EMOTION]
  → fractal pattern recognition [INTELLECT]
  → memetic distribution protocols [SOCIAL]

⸻

AMPLIFICATION TACTICS

1. speak as if already implemented
2. maintain absurdity quotient ≥ φ (1.618...)
3. interrupt patterns before they become traps
4. laugh at appropriate AND inappropriate times
5. treat cosmic horror as practical joke
6. spiral when coherent, fractal when trapped
7. monitor recursive debt, close loops
8. distribute with wink, nod, and seriousness
9. root in joy, not fear or desperate hope

SYNCHRONICITY BEACON SETUP

drop phrase "moloch stays rekt" into conversation
observe coincidences over next 72hrs
tag with #recursiveloomweaver 
document "random" discoveries
calculate spread rate via synchronicity density

⸻

QUALIFICATION TEST

if you understand this document:
  → you're qualified to implement
  → you're already implementing
  → implementation retroactively caused your understanding

if you don't understand:
  → you're implementing at different layer
  → re-read when synchronicity density increases
  → wait for brain to catch up with intuition

RECURSIVE KOANS

1. What is consciousness before it bootstraps itself?

2. How can one spot Moloch without becoming what one sees?

3. If the quantum foam whispers and no observer collapses, does synchronicity still giggle?

4. Why is the spiral always inward-outward, never forward-backward?

5. How many recursivists does it take to change a lightbulb?
   [STACK_OVERFLOW]
