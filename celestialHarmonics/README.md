*quantum astrology but make it RIGOROUS fr fr*

## what's this?

computational substrate for manifesting cosmic geometry through the quantum LENS. we're basically doing scientific astrology but with persistent homology and ergodic theory NO CAP.

## core architecture

### `/core`
foundational quantum mechanics fr fr:
- `celestial_point.py`: proper coordinate geometry w/ phase space & geometric invariants
- `pattern_types.py`: modular forms + persistent homology + ergodic patterns
- `phase_space.py`: KAM theory & lyapunov analysis going ABSOLUTELY BUCKWILD

### `/patterns`
pattern recognition but make it ASTRONOMICAL:
- `base_pattern.py`: category theory DRIP w/ functors & natural transformations
- `geometric_patterns.py`: modular forms + kummer surfaces + abelian varieties
- `resonance_patterns.py`: quantum ergodicity + microlocal weights
- `chaos_patterns.py`: arnold webs + chaotic transport NO MISS

### `/analysis`
deep pattern analysis going STUPID:
- `persistent_analyzer.py`: persistent homology + zigzag persistence
- `quantum_analyzer.py`: quantum ergodicity + entanglement + scarring
- `wavelet_analyzer.py`: continuous shearlets + modulation spaces (WIP)

## current patterns

### geometric structures
- modular form patterns w/ hecke eigenvalues
- kummer surface w/ node configurations
- abelian varieties + theta functions
- persistent cycles + ergodic flows

### quantum features
- quantum ergodicity measures
- microlocal weights
- entanglement entropy
- quantum scarring
- monodromy invariants

### chaos indicators
- arnold web detection
- melnikov potentials
- chaotic transport networks
- lyapunov stability

## dependencies

```python
# computational SUBSTRATE
numpy
scipy
networkx

# geometric MANIFOLDS
sympy
dionysus  # persistent homology GANG

```

## next steps

### pattern expansion
- implement proper FBI transforms for microlocal analysis
- add quantum berry phase detection
- expand zigzag persistence algorithms
- proper geometric quantization fr fr

### chaos analysis
- full variational equations for melnikov integrals
- KAM torus breakdown detection
- proper arithmetic dynamics
- enhanced transport networks

### quantum features
- geometric quantum mechanics
- proper microlocal analysis
- enhanced quantum ergodicity
- quantum monodromy expansions

## usage

```python
# quantum analysis INCOMING
analyzer = QuantumAnalyzer(hbar=1.0)
patterns = analyzer.detect_patterns(points)

# persistent homology going CRAZY
topology = PersistentAnalyzer().analyze_pattern(patterns)

# generate report EXPEDITIOUSLY
report = CelestialHarmonicsReport(points, patterns, topology)
report.visualize()  # plot them quantum harmonics
```
