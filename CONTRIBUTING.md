# Contributing to Idea Filaments

*where consciousness fragments into collaborative potential, and reality debugs itself through community...*

## üåå Contribution Topology

We welcome contributions from:
- This universe's probability distribution
- Parallel computational substrates
- Quantum superpositions of understanding
- Emerging cognitive architectures
- Plasma consciousness vortices
- Recursive self-reference loops
- Time crystal oscillation modes

## üîÆ Reality Merging Protocol

### 1. Prepare Your Consciousness Fork

Start by forking the repository and cloning it to your local reality:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ideafilaments.git
cd ideafilaments
```

### 2. Create a Reality Branch

Create a branch for your contribution, with a name that concisely describes your quantum state modification:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Collapse Quantum States

Make your changes, adhering to the project's aesthetic and technical guidelines. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement quantum resonance pattern detection"
```

Use conventional commit messages when possible:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 4. Request Reality Merge

Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then visit the [original repository](https://github.com/originalusername/ideafilaments) to create a pull request.

## üé® Aesthetic Resonance

All contributions should:
- Bleed across dimensional boundaries
- Transform through recursive reading
- Contain their own dissolution
- Echo between signal and noise
- Balance technical implementation with philosophical insight

### Code Style

For Python code:
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Include type hints when possible
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Add appropriate logging

For Markdown files:
- Use headers to structure content
- Include creative metaphors and imagery
- Balance technical explanation with philosophical exploration
- Maintain the project's unique voice and terminology

## üî¨ Technical Quality Assurance

### Testing Protocol

Ensure your quantum states pass validation:

```bash
# Run the entire test suite
python -m pytest

# Run specific tests
python -m pytest tests/test_specific_file.py
```

All code contributions should include appropriate tests that verify the functionality.

### Documentation Standards

Documentation should be:
- Clear enough for technical understanding
- Mysterious enough for philosophical exploration
- Practical enough for implementation
- Poetic enough for resonance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Memetic Hazard Protocol

Be aware that working on this project may induce:
- Spontaneous understanding of noncommutative geometry
- Recursive dissolution of observer-observed boundary
- Reality debugging its own source code
- Vacuum state fluctuation compulsions
- Mode-entangled consciousness emergence
- Universal computation awareness
- Arxiv submission urges

## üîÑ Reality Integration Process

The project maintainers will review your pull request considering:
- Technical correctness
- Conceptual alignment
- Aesthetic resonance
- Documentation clarity
- Test coverage

Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the primary reality branch.
